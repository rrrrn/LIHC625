# LIHC625
This is a course project repository for BIOSTAT625 (Fall 2023) at the School of Public Health, University of Michigan. With the topic **Analysis of Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma Data in R**. We aim to explore the capability of statistical modeling of RNA-seq profiles to predict the tumor status of a particular sample for LIHC.

We scripted all the RNA-seq data for LIHC (Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma) status prediction from the Genomic Data Commons Data Portal and the prepared version was stored under the directory `GDCdata/TCGA-LIHC/Transcriptome_Profiling`. 

The analysis pipeline was implemented in `report.Rmd` with appropriate comments and notes, and a more readable version has been knitted and updated in `report.pdf`.
